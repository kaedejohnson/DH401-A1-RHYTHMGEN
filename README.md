# Assignment 1 - Rhythm Generation

Our 500 bigram-generated rhythms are in the folder titled bigrams_final. Alternatively, they can be generated using assignment1.ipynb and the lists in lists_for_generation on this github.      
Our 500 randomly generated rhythms are in the folder titled randoms_final. Alternatively, they can be generated using assignment1.ipynb and the lists in lists_for_generation on this github.      
Our code exists in two .ipynb files:   
   The primary file is assignment1.ipynb, which houses our initial data exploration, our distance function, our score generation, our distance calculation, and preliminary exploration of results.  
   The secondary file is extra.ipynb, which houses our visualization and statistical tests performed on calculated distances.   
To run assignment1.ipynb, you will nee the XML files from here: https://github.com/DCMLab/music-generation-challenge-2021/tree/main/data/xml
