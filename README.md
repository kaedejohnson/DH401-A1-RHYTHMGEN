Our 500 bigram-generated rhythms are in the folder titled bigrams_final.  
Our 500 randomly generated rhythms are in the folder titled randoms_final.  
Our code exists in two .ipynb files:   
   The primary file is assignment1.ipynb, which houses our initial data exploration, our distance function, our score generation, our distance calculation, and preliminary exploration of results.  
   The secondary file is extra.ipynb, which houses our visualization and statistical tests performed on calculated distances.
